                    <h2>Concretizing the Circular Economy in the Algarve Region: Practices and Challenges in the Tourism, Sea, and Agri-food Sectors</h2>
                </header>
                <p><strong>Mendes, Ana Beatriz; Marques da Costa, Eduarda; Marreiros, Aquiles</strong></p>
                <p>
                    In Algarve, the development of the Circular Economy Regional Agenda (CCDR-Alg, 2019) has marked the discussion with the purpose to accelerate and stimulate the region’s transition to a more circular economy (CE). This communication aims to identify the profile of waste produced by the Tourism, Sea, and Agri-food sectors in the region, with the objective to identify potential opportunities for its reuse and changes in new business models that meet its reduction and/or elimination. In this context, questionnaires were developed targeted at the companies in the aforementioned sectors in the region with the purpose to: identify waste production (quantity) and where it ends; and characterize the practices adopted by companies in the transition to a CE. Questionnaires results show some common waste to the three sectors. In Tourism, organic and food waste stand out, as well as packaging waste. From the Sea, waste from fishing nets, lines, and traps appear, complemented by motor oils. In the Agri-food sector, organic waste and cardboard stand out. It is concluded that despite the importance that CE has in policies, its effectiveness within the framework of economic actors must be enhanced, highlighting the need to strengthen the dissemination of new practices among actors, as well as the creation of incentives for new business models (CCDR-Alg, 2021).
                </p>
                <h3>Keywords:</h3>
                <p>Circular Economy; Regional Strategy; Tourism; Sea; Agri-food; Algarve</p>

                <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    This work arises from the need to articulate key sectors in a circular economy context in the region with the domains defined for the Regional Strategy 2030, aiming to identify potential opportunities for the reuse of produced waste and the introduction of changes in new business models that meet their reduction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The focus on the waste sector is due to the lack of available information on waste production and management in the region, especially for more specific waste groups associated with the main activity sectors of the region. The choice of the sectors under analysis, namely Tourism, Sea, and Agri-food, is due to their highest potential for circularity in the region, as well as producers of high volumes of waste.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, questionnaires were developed targeting companies in these sectors in the region with the objectives of identifying waste production (quantity) and its destination and characterizing the practices adopted by companies in the transition to a circular economy, to subsequently identify the best way to manage this waste.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Circular Economy</h3>
                <p>
                    The concept of Circular Economy is relatively recent, but the idea behind it arises from environmental concerns (Smol, Kulczycka & Avdiushchenko, 2017). It was first addressed in 1990, as a closed model based on the interdependence between the economy and the environment, aiming to improve innovation, efficiency, resource preservation, and increase job creation and the lifespan of goods through the reduction, reuse, recovery, and recycling of materials and energies (Banaitė, 2016; Lemos, 2018; Prieto-Sandoval et al., 2016).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This concept emerged associated with the increase in urban population and consumption and their consequences on the natural resources of the regions. The CE currently focuses on three principles "Reduce, Reuse and Recycle", determining a production model that allows the re-entry of materials into the economic cycle (Mendes et al, 2020, cit. Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2012).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the context of Regional Circular Economy Agendas, sectors with the highest potential for circularity in the Algarve region were identified, including Tourism, construction and demolition waste, sludge, textiles, and fishing (CCDR-Alg, 2020). Subsequently, several strategies, action plans, and projects have been developed, more or less directly, in these sectors in the region, such as the Study of the Regional Metabolism Analysis of the Algarve (Nisa, 2019), the Action Plan for RCD in the Algarve Region (CCDR-Alg, 3Drivers, & Smart Waste Portugal, 2019) and various workshops to encourage the transition of companies and entities in the region to a more circular and sustainable economy.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Methods</h3>
                <p>
                    To identify the waste profile produced in the Algarve region in the three sectors, one of the methods used was the questionnaire, to address the lack of information on the production, management, and destination of waste produced by companies in the region.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prior to the development of the questionnaires, work was carried out to identify the main wastes in each sector, to facilitate the elaboration, completion, and analysis of the questionnaires. For the Tourism sector, the products and wastes identified refer to the products and wastes identified for the questionnaire prepared by CCDR Algarve within the scope of the ECRESHOT project - Circular Economy and Hotel Soap Waste. In the Agri-food and Sea sectors, scientific literature and regional documents were used as references, complemented with contributions from the Regional Directorate of Agriculture and Fisheries of the Algarve (DRAP Algarve). Nevertheless, open questions were included to identify other wastes besides those initially considered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The questionnaires were divided into 3 parts, with different focuses:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Establishment: Identification and characterization of the company;</li>
                        <li>Products and Wastes: Identification of the main products and wastes produced/consumed by the company, and their quantities and destinations;</li>
                        <li>Circularity of the Company: Measures adopted or intended to be adopted by the company in the context of transition to a circular economy.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    For all identified products and wastes, the quantity acquired/used in 2019 was questioned, if waste separation is carried out (Yes; No), the destination of the produced wastes (Selective deposition; Mixed with other wastes of the establishment; Other), and the routing of the produced wastes (Licensed company; Selective deposition equipment; Other).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the last phase of this questionnaire, it was intended to analyze the concerns and commitment of companies in implementing principles and measures for the transition to a more circular and sustainable economy, through a question to identify measures and best practices that companies have already implemented, are in the process of implementing, or have no intention of implementing. This is essential to understand the progress of strategy adoption by companies in each sector so that more favorable conditions can be created for the transition to a circular economy in the Algarve region, both publicly and privately.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Results and Discussion</h3>
                <p>
                    In Table 1, it is possible to verify all the wastes, in each of the sectors, that were previously identified in the questionnaire directed to Algarve companies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The questionnaires were launched on November 24, 2020, and were available until February 10, 2021. All contacts made via email were categorized according to the sector and type of entities (companies, entities with associates/partners, and entities with beneficiaries of the developed projects).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Table 2 shows the number of entities that participated in the questionnaires, highlighting that in all three sectors, responses were obtained from companies with different geographical locations in the Algarve, predominantly those located in Albufeira and Faro.

                <p>
                    Some wastes are common across the three sectors (e.g., plastic). In Tourism, organic and food waste, as well as packaging waste, stand out. From the Sea, fishing nets, lines, and traps waste, complemented by motor oils, appear. In the Agri-food sector, organic waste and cardboard stand out. Some of the main wastes are common to more than one sector, such as plastic, cardboard, food, and/or organic waste, and used oils.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Companies were questioned about the implementation or willingness to implement some measures and best practices, such as: Innovation measures at the product and production process level, efficient water and energy use, reuse and recovery of wastewater, training and awareness actions, preference to market proximity, collaboration on collaborative platforms, valorization of by-products, preference for the use of circular and biological materials, inclusion of sustainability in environmental strategies, among others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The results showed that, in general, respondents show, besides availability, a willingness to participate in the transition process to a circular economy, as many companies already have several of these measures implemented or in the process of implementation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most implemented or in-process measures identified were: Including sustainability in environmental measures; Training and awareness actions for best practices (employees/managers/consumers); Innovation measures at the product and production processes level; Efficient water use measures; Efficient energy use measures; Collaboration on Collaborative Platforms between various actors; and Ensuring selective waste collection and proper routing to waste management entities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Measures that showed greater resistance from companies can be justified by the complexity and financial burden associated with them, such as wastewater recovery and reuse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the Sea sector, a greater difficulty was generally observed in the availability of companies to adopt some measures. Namely, in the investment in equipment aimed at improving waste management on board the vessel, the collection of marine debris by fishermen, ensuring that fishing nets, lines, and traps are routed to waste management entities for reuse, and the reuse of food waste by the entity itself or sent to a competent entity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the Agri-food sector, it is important to address issues related to the difficulty of recycling some agricultural plastics, especially those contaminated with soil, sand, and/or pesticides, which have a significant weight in the region. One proposed innovation solution for almost all plastic wastes in this sector is the production and use of agricultural products that replace plastic with biodegradable materials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the case of the Sea sector, wastes are quite diverse, often consisting of more than one material, making their management difficult. It is crucial to ensure that these wastes do not end up in the sea and that companies are increasingly aware of this problem to help reverse the current situation of marine pollution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the Tourism sector, the most concerning issue is the uncontrolled growth of waste produced in the Algarve region by tourism activity, making it currently the Portuguese region responsible for the highest percentage of waste from the Tourism sector.
                </p>

                <h3>5. Conclusions</h3>
                <p>
                    More and more companies are concerned with environmental, sustainable, and circular issues and need to adapt through measures and business models that align with, for example, more circular product designs and production processes, and the development of new business models, among others. However, although companies can promote some principles and measures, some factors, which are not solely dependent on companies, are crucial to accelerate and promote the transition to a more sustainable and circular economy in a business context.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is essential to create access conditions to financing and risk management tools so that companies can invest in capital and R&D, and to stimulate effective collaboration between value chains and various sectors, especially in a regional context, to effectively stimulate a more circular economy and more business opportunities that meet this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is concluded that despite the importance that CE holds in guidelines and policies, its effectiveness within the framework of economic actors must be enhanced, highlighting the need to reinforce the dissemination of new practices among actors, as well as the creation of incentives for new business models (CCDR-Alg, 2021).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following this project, with the aim of effective collaboration between value chains and various sectors, especially in a regional context, innovation communities are planned to discuss ways of operationalizing the Circular Economy and its articulation with the Regional Strategy 2030, focusing on valuing and creating technology-based business ideas (Start-ups), identifying and valuing R&D results that can be commercialized through the creation of new companies (Spin-Offs), fostering entrepreneurial discovery processes, and promoting the dissemination of funding lines for business projects.
